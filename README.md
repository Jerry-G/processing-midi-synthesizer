# processing-midi-synthesizer
The goal of this project is to play midi files with simple waves made posible by the minim extention available in processing. Processing is itself an extention of java and can be found at https://processing.org/download/?processing (cross platform).




# Turning midi to csv
Inorder to feed the midi file to this program it must be in .csv file format. The midicsv program does exactly that and can be found at http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/#Download (cross platform).



# Minim
The minim extention can be downloaded from within the processing program by hovering over the "Sketch" tab in the toolbar, then clicking on "Import Library.." and "Add Library".
